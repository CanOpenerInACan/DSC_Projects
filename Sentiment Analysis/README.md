This project was part of a group project and presentation.
In this project we gathered tweets to create our own CSV file, then used those tweets to measure the sentiment and try to predict
stock prices based on the sentiment found. 

The tweet gathering code is there, as long as the file for running code on the sentiment, as well as the prices during those days. Our presentation can be found
