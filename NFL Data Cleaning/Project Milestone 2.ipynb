    "**Quick Breakdown:** So far I have gotten to look through some of the data, and realize there is a lot still to do. I will give a quick breakdown of what I have done so far, as well as everything else I need to do before I can work with a lot of this. So far I have made two dataframes, one for receivers (both wide receivers and tight ends) and one for running backs (also includes full backs). I checked to make sure I could combine them into one if I really wanted, and I can, but for now they will stay separated so we can look at them separate. I got rid of nearly 20,000 rows that we weren't interested in because they were pre-season or pro bowl games and we don't want those. As for things I still need to do... Its a lot. I didn't want to delete any columns because even though there were some that weren't in my original thinking, home vs away would be interesting to look into, and so I havent messed with that yet. I want to condense the Player ID and Name into one column, figure out how to remove people who did not accumulate stats, but this may not work well. If a player played a game but has no catches or stats we have here, it will all show as '--', but that should still count against them. But if they didn't play, it will show the same. I think. So I'm struggling to figure out how to work with this. Removing dud games will inflate stats, removing rows based off the 'Games Started' category on if a player started a game will remove a bunch of stats, so I need to figure out what I am doing. I also need to find a place that has the last 3 years worth of stats that I can find here to add them. Basically I need to mess with and clean the data a lot more and get familiar with the data I have. Remove some stuff we don't care about or can easily find (we don't really need yards, receptions AND yard/reception. We can calculate yards/reception if needed). Luckily the earliest year recorded is 1970, but we may still cut down the amount of data we have by removing anything pre 2000, just to cut the data and get a more accurate current day view of the game. I have a lot of work to do, and cleaning will be a pain, but once it is all done, should be able to fit a decent model and learn some thing. We also have a few categories that need to be converted to numerical data types so we can run analysis, but have some \"NaNs\" and \"--\"s that stop that right now. Oh man and as I type this, I realize there is a 'Games Played' category, which tells us if the player played. If we have 'Games Played' == 0 we can remove them. They all have '--' for all their stats and did not play. Ok good. I'll include that bit of exploring code below and we can remove them after. Sorry I did a lot of messing around as I typed this trying to figure out how to do the things I needed. But these should help. Hopefully this is enough transformations for the week even though I didn't do a ton of transforming and was more getting into the details of the DataFrames. But there will be a lot more next week hopefully. "
